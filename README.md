# SubMe 

A cloud deployment of ![Autosub](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub) on Google Colab. It leverages Google's cloud computing clusters and GPU to automatically generate subtitles for uploaded video files in various languages. Audio is first pre-processed using `ffmpeg` and `ffmpeg-normalize`. Speech recognition is then conducted on the pre-processed audio using `Auditok`, after which `ffmpeg` will be used to splice the audio files into individual segments. The segments will be transcribed using Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API, then translated into your desired language using `py-googletrans`. 

Our tool significantly speeds up the runtime of Autosub. As a free service, the GPU-enabled Google Colab environment (which is what we are using now) is significantly faster than a GPU-enabled MacBook Pro, Lenovo Legion and Lenovo Thinkpad, contributing to greater time savings. Furthermore, without the need to provision and maintain expensive hardware, users will also enjoy greater cost savings. Moreover, our tool will also help the less fortunate, such as those with hearing disabilities, to decipher what is being spoken in videos and movies.
